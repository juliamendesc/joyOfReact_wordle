# Project - Word Game

This project was made during the course of Josh W Comeau's Couse [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

![Wordle Demo](https://github.com/juliamendesc/joyOfReact_wordle/blob/main/docs/wordle-demo.gif?raw=true)

It intends to be a simplified recreation of the game [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

# How to play

- You will need to guess the word. If you have a right letter in the right place, the square will become green. If the letter is right, but is misplaced, the square becomes yellow. If the letter isn't in the word, the square remains gray.
- You have a total of 6 guesses.

# How to run it locally
